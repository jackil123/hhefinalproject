        <p>Thank you for trying out the environmental health simulator!  Here is a page explaining in
            detail how the choices you made affected your life, and lead to either your good health or
            ill health.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first choice, you had the option to choose produce.  The main environmental health 
            concern in this scenario is the presence of pesticides in the produce we buy.
            Pesticides make their way from the fields into our kitchens, and have been shown to cause
            serious health problems. According to the WHO, "[Pesticides] may induce adverse health effects including cancer, 
            effects on reproduction, immune or nervous systems."  Certain crops require more pesticides and harmful
            chemicals in the growing process, meaning they are less safe to eat.

            For the second choice, you had the option to choose seafood.  All seafood has mercury in it
            but due to a process known as biomagnification, the higher up the food chain and the larger
            the marine animal is the higher the concentration of mercury it contains.  Because of this,
            it is safer to eat smaller fish, and due to the presence of POPs (persisten organic pollutants),
            fish from certain parts of the world are safer.

        </p>

            For the third choice, you had the option to choose from several different locations around
            the world to reside in.  All the possible options have unsafe levels of air pollution, but
            Riyadh, Saudi Arabia has slightly better air quality than Peshawar and Onitsha.  Peshawar and
            Onitsha have two of the worst air quality ratings in the world.

            For the fourth choice, you had the option to choose form several different methods of hydration.
            In a country that doesn't often have the cleanest water, it is important to choose the right
            source from which you will drink.  Bottled water can cause sickness, because the plastics and
            other materials it is stored in can leach into the water stored inside, in the form of PCBs and
            other endocrine-disrupting chemicals.  Tap water is safer, but it is often treated, and sourced
            from areas that might be polluted.  The safest bet is water from a well you dug far away from any 
            development.  The natural hydrological processes that bring water to aquifers and then back up to 
            the surface have a filtering effect, creating clean, drinkable and safe water.

            For the fifth choice, you now had to choose how you would earn a living in your new home.
            Many jobs, espcially those that include hard labor (those which are most available to
            immigrants), carry with them occupational hazards, many of which come from the chemicals
            that you would come into contact with on a day to day basis.  As we learned in the first
            choice, modern day farming requires heavy use of strong pesticides and herbicides, so as 
            a farm laborer you would be exposed to these such chemicals, which can wreak havoc on your
            body.

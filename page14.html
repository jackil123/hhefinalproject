        <p>Good job, you made the right choice!  Well water is the safest kind of water you can drink,
            especially compared to bottled water and tap water.  Bottled water often can have chemicals
            in it from the plastic that it is stored in, which can disrupt your endocrine system.  Tap water
            is safer, but still not as clean as well water, which is naturally filtered by hydrological
            processes.

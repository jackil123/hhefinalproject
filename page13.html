        <p>Oh no, you picked the wrong choice!  Your choice of hydration was full of pollutants from the air,
            ground, and the vessel your water was stored and transported in.  These pollutants are now causing
            harm to your nervous and endocrine systems, and you better hope you're not having a baby anytime soon.

            carrying.

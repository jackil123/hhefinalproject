        <p>Good job, you made the right choice!  Working as a farm-laborer can expose you to the dangerous
            pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals used to protect crops.  Working in a coal fired powerplant
            can expose you to airborne pollutants that are a byproduct of the coal-burning process.
